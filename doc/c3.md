# Navigation
The user can navigate through the website using the navigation bar at the top of every page.

# Forms
On the contact us page the user can fill out a form that accepts the following values:
- name
- email
- message

Each of the values is validated using javascript when the form is submitted. You can check the verification code present in the file [form.js](../src/js/form.js).

# HTML5 and CSS3 validation
As requested by the teacher, the validation of the files using the W3C validator is as follows:
![landing-page-validation](images/validation/landing-page.png)
![about-page-validation](images/validation/about-page.png)
![contact-page-validation](images/validation/contact-page.png)
![api-page-validation](images/validation/api-page.png)

# Implementation details
All the minimum requirements stated by the teacher have been met and can be identified from the .html and .css files in the [src folder](../src).
As enhancement elements it is possible to verify the [form.js file](../src/js/form.js) where javascript was used to validate the form data of the contact us page.
