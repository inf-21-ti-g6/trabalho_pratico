# C1: Newtur - A new kind of tourism

## Description
Newtur aims to make global tourism more technological and modern by creating smart locks with the goal of replacing physical keys and cards.
In order to achieve this goal, these locks communicate with our service and allow the creation of credentials that can be sent directly to the customer.
